# Configuring-SSH
A configuration guide for SSH clients and servers.

All commands are preceded by the character `$` (to be executed as normal users) and `#` (root user) to make a distinction from lines on the configuration files.

(Note: These documents only lists the CHANGES that need to be performed in a server installation. Unchanged settings are assumed to be secure by default, so tuning those parameters is at your own risk.)
